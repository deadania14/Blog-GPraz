# GPraz.xyz #

My personal [blog](https://gpraz.xyz) created using Django Framework. For now, the features are simple:

* Article view count
* Pagination
* CKEditor WYSIWYG editor
* Enhanced admin page
* Frontend using bootstrap
* etc

## Background ##

This simple blog was created so my friends from college could learn 
something from it. You may find some mistakes and incorrect 
implementations. When I first learned Python and Django, I thought that 
this framework was simple enough you could build web application quickly 
and easily. Django documentation is complete and they included code 
examples there.

That's all
